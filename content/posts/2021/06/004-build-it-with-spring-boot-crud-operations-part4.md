This series builds Java applications using [Spring Boot 2][1], which has become de-facto standard for building applications in Java world. It makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications. It cuts down on a lot of boilerplate code, and its sensible defaults for configurations allows to build applications in super quick time.

The project we are building here is a Spring Boot Web application that demonstrates [CRUD operations][2]. The application allows to manage student information, by a paginated student list, adding a new student, viewing student information, editing them, and deleting them. The application also has Login/Logout feature.
