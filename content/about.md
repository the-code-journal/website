This website is essentially my code journal.

Yes, it may appear more or less like any other tutorial website with a bunch of articles, but it is not. Usual tutorials are more about getting you getting the stuff running. For example, here is what you need in your `pom.xml`, here are the `Java classes`, here are some other changes, and then you run. Good, you can build something, now go to the next article for doing something a little more of that, using the same process.

I don't believe code is written like that. Things are added gradually to every piece of code and there is some rationale behind it. It's this rationality that differentiates between great coders from the rest. Journies are more important that reaching the destination and it is particular true in the world of code. Yes, you can have an application that just does Login/Logout functionality, and there are plethora of ways of doing it, there are multiple languagues and even more frameworks/tools/libraries to do that. It's process of chosing one language over another, one approach over another that allows to build the rationality, understanding.

I strive to write these articles with this approach - to document the slow progression of code from beginning to the end. The articles tries to be more elaborate whereever possible, and I make conscious effort to put those small details, that small pro tip, that not so familiar or usual thing, that usually is removed from the regular tutorials since they want you to get up an running. I would like these articles to feel like you are going through the journey of learning as you would be doing it along with a peer.

That would mean that sometimes, the articles will be filled with lots of details which might not seem relevant, some articles might be linked to another and to do the thing in one article, you might have to go do something else in another article. But, that is how code is written. It progresses over the period of time like that. As I said, running a code is just one aspect. Knowling the things around it, the various caveats are all necessary for better understanding of the code so that if at all you decide to adapt these somewhere, you know what parts need to adjusted.

I envision this website to be the quick reference for things.

If you read any of the articles of this website, I would really appreciate leaving a feedback, support and/or especially criticism. That will enable me to make the quality of these articles better.
